    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey, I'm Pog — a developer driven by curiosity, creativity, and an unhealthy relationship with the VSCode terminal. <br><br>
        
        What started as a fascination with Roblox game development quickly evolved into a passion for creating useful discord bots and interactive websites.
        
        Whether it's a bot that keeps Discord communities running smoothly, or a productivity dashboard that simplifies daily workflows, I aim to design software that's both functional
        and fun.

        I enjoy working on projects that blend logic and creativity. <br><br>
        
        My toolkit includes Python, LuaU, C#, Go, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — 
        and I'm always eager to pick up new skills when a project calls for it.

        When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me gaming, learning something new, or brainstorming my next big idea.
        <br><br>
